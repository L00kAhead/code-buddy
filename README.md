Code Buddy adds a small animated cat companion to your JetBrains IDE.

The cat walks along the bottom of the editor window and can be paused, resumed, or hidden entirely using the Code Buddy tool window. The plugin is designed to be lightweight and distraction free, adding a small amount of personality to the IDE without interfering with normal development.

Code Buddy works across all JetBrains IDEs and starts automatically when a project is opened.
